               Players take turns to roll a dice. On each turn, the player rolls the die as many times as they want. The result of each roll is added to their current score for that turn.

               A player may choose to "Hold" at any time during their turn to add the current score to their total score and pass the turn to the other player.

               If the player rolls a 1, they lose all points accumulated during that turn, and their turn passes to the second player.

               The game continues until one of the players reaches a total score of 100 or more points.
