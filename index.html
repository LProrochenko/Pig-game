            Players take turns to roll a dice. On each turn, the player rolls
            the die as many times as they want. The result of each roll is added
            to their current score for that turn.

            A player may choose to "Hold" at any time during their turn to add
            the current score to their total score and pass the turn to the
            other player.

          <p class="instruction-text">
            If the player rolls a 1, they lose all points accumulated during
            that turn, and their turn passes to the second player.

            The game continues until one of the players reaches a total score of
